With this script you can copy-paste images to a web page and they will be uploaded into the same folder.

Put this PHP script on the server in the folder where you want images to be uploaded.

Create `config.php` with the following variables defined:

```
<?php
$username = "USERNAME";
$password = "PASSWORD";
?>
```

Note: this script is half-assed and leans on AI generated code. It is probably full of security holes. Don't use it for important production sites.
