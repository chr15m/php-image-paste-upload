A PHP page where you can paste images and they get uploaded into the same folder.

Put this PHP script on the server in the folder where you want images to be uploaded.

Create `config.php` with the following variables defined:

```
<?php
$username = "USERNAME";
$password = "PASSWORD";
?>
```

Note: this script is half-assed and leans on AI generated code. It is probably full of security holes. Don't use it for important production sites.
